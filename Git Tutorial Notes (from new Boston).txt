** From thenewboston git tutorial**
-----------------------------------
Git Bash will be UNIX operating. 
Commands:
	ls - look at files / folders in the currenty directory
	cd - current directory
	cd .. - go back one directory
	'ls -la' - looks at all the files in the directory, including the invisible files

Git Commands:
	git init - creates that directory as a GIT repository. Everything in the folder will be tracked for GIT.
	git commit -m "" - creates a snapshot of your code. Similar to save button. Commits are how you get back
			   to certain points in time.
	git log - tells you what has been happening in that specific folder for GIT
	git status - tells you the status of that GIT directory (ex: untracked/new files added)
	git add __name of file__ (ex: git add test.py). This will add the specific file to the staging area
		working copy > staging area > repository
			Staging area: these are the files that are ready to get committed. Repo is end goal.
	
Q: How to edit files?
A: Edit the file, git status to see if it detects the edits, git add __name of file__ (this will add to STAGING AREA)
   git commit -m "", now make sure it's inserted and do git status to check if it's good.

Q: How to edit multiple files?
A: git status, git add . (staging area), git commit -m "", git status to check.
